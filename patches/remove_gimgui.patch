 // - Using Dear ImGui via a shared library is not recommended, because of function call overhead and because we don't guarantee backward nor forward ABI compatibility.
 // - Confused? In a debugger: add GImGui to your watch window and notice how its value changes depending on your current location (which DLL boundary you are in).
 
-// Current context pointer. Implicitly used by all Dear ImGui functions. Always assumed to be != NULL.
-// - ImGui::CreateContext() will automatically set this pointer if it is NULL.
-//   Change to a different context by calling ImGui::SetCurrentContext().
-// - Important: Dear ImGui functions are not thread-safe because of this pointer.
-//   If you want thread-safety to allow N threads to access N different contexts:
-//   - Change this variable to use thread local storage so each thread can refer to a different context, in your imconfig.h:
-//         struct ImGuiContext;
-//         extern thread_local ImGuiContext* MyImGuiTLS;
-//         #define GImGui MyImGuiTLS
-//     And then define MyImGuiTLS in one of your cpp files. Note that thread_local is a C++11 keyword, earlier C++ uses compiler-specific keyword.
-//   - Future development aims to make this context pointer explicit to all calls. Also read https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/issues/586
-//   - If you need a finite number of contexts, you may compile and use multiple instances of the ImGui code from a different namespace.
-// - DLL users: read comments above.

 // Memory Allocator functions. Use SetAllocatorFunctions() to change them.
 // - You probably don't want to modify that mid-program, and if you use global/static e.g. ImVector<> instances you may need to keep them accessible during program destruction.
